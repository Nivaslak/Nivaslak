# Welcome to My GitHub Account!
## Hello, and welcome to my GitHub account! Here you will find a collection of my projects and contributions. Feel free to explore, contribute, and provide feedback.

## About Me
I am a passionate developer with a keen interest in data science. I love working on innovative projects that challenge me and allow me to expand my skills. I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements.

## Projects - Python
Here are some of the notable projects I have worked on:
The below projects are avilable in : (https://github.com/Nivaslak/finalCapstone)
# Project 1:
Finance Calculator : This Python script calculates the amount of interest on an investment or the monthly repayment amount for a home loan (bond). It provides options for calculating both simple and compound interest for investments.
# Project 2:
Minesweeper : This Python script implements a simple Mine Sweeper game. It takes a predefined minefield represented by a 2D array and prints out the number of adjacent mines for each spot.
# Project 3:
Age Vs Insurance :This file contains Python code that demonstrates the use of linear regression to analyze a dataset using the pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the relationship between age and insurance charges.
# Project 4:
Age Vs Spending: This file contains Python code that demonstrates the relationship between age and spending score using linear regression analysis. The code utilizes the pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries to load the data, plot a scatter plot, fit a linear regression model, and visualize the best fit line.

## Projects - PowerBi
This Power BI project aims to analyze and present insights from a survey conducted among data professionals. The survey gathered information about various aspects related to data management, analysis, and industry trends. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the survey results, enabling data professionals to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions.

## Feel free to explore each project repository to learn more about the implementation details, technologies used, and the problems they solve.
